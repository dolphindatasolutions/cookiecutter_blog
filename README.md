# Dolphin Data blog cookiecutter

This is a template for an analysis for a dolphindata.co.uk blog post

## Motivation

The blog posts are likely to follow 3 repetitive steps:
- Get data from some source (API, csv etc.)
- Process the data into a useable format
- Analyse/plot the data and incorporate in some kind of report

Currently this will be done in R, using knitr to make the final report
